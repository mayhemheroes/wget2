Hi %TO_NAME%,

I'd like to thank you for the contributions you have made to GNU Wget2.

We at GNU try to enforce software freedom through a Copyleft

take proactive action when violations are found. Hence, we assign the
copyrights of the code to the FSF allowing them to act against anyone
that violates the license of the code you have written.

We, the maintainers of GNU Wget hence hereby request that you assign
the copyrights of the previous contributions that you have made, and
any future contributions to the FSF.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to reply back to this
mail. We will be glad to answer them and help you out.
