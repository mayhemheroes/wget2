Hi,

we are happy to announce the release 2.0.1 of GNU Wget2.

Wget2 is the successor of GNU Wget, a file and recursive website
downloader.

Designed and written from scratch it wraps around libwget, that provides
the basic functions needed by a web client.

Wget2 works multi-threaded and uses many features to allow fast operation.

Wget2 has the potential to download faster than Wget due to HTTP2,
HTTP compression, parallel connections, use of If-Modified-Since HTTP header
and other techniques. Especially recursive or multi-URL downloads benefit.

Wget2 has several new command-line options, see the wiki page for a list and
comparison with Wget.

Wget will be maintained further. The idea is that breaking changes and new
functionalities go into Wget2 / libwget.

Except for WARC and FTP, Wget2 is a drop-in replacement for Wget in most cases.
Of course there may be subtle differences, so make sure to test well before
replacing Wget by Wget2.

GNU Wget2 is licensed under GPLv3+. Libwget is licensed under LGPLv3+.
