# Google Summer of Code 2019 Final Report

Wget2 supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols, both with and without Transport Layer Security (TLS). The earlier testsuite was able to only test HTTP/1.1. During the project, we added support for h2 (HTTP/2 with TLS) testing. For implementation, we extended the HTTP/1.1 testsuite's interface to h2 protocol. The support for testing HTTP/2 without TLS was not added due to lack of utility. We followed a two-pass approach, we made the existing tests go through both the protocols.

The latter part of the project added support for testing the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) which is responsible for checking the revocation status of TLS certificates. It allowed checking if Wget2 handles OCSP (Stapled or otherwise) response correctly. It also checks if the client is able to properly communicate with an OCSP Response Server.

## Work Done
Extensions to the testsuite:
1. HTTP/2
2. OCSP Responder
3. OCSP (Stapling)

## Work Left
1. Test OCSP Stapling with revoked response.
2. Test OCSP with caching enabled.

## Change in Code Coverage
**libwget**\
The final measures do not include the increased coverage due to OCSP Stapling.
* Overall: From 73.3% to 77.9%
* libwget/ssl_gnutls.c: From 48.0% to 66.5%
* libwget/http.c: From 54.3% to 79.3%

## HTTP/2 Support

3. **enum** PASS proto_pass\
This variable controls the PASSES through which a test goes through.\
    Values:
    > HTTP_1_PASS = 0\
    > H2_PASS = 1\
    > END_PASS = 2
4. **int** wget_test_get_h2_server_port(void)
	> Returns 'h2' server's port if the server is running\
	> Otherwise, returns `-1`.

Modified:
1. **enum** SERVER_MODE\
Added new value `HTTPS_MODE`.
2. **int** wget_test_get_http_server(void)\
Returns http/h2 server's port depending on `proto_pass`
3. **int** wget_test_get_http2_server(void)\
Returns https/h2 server's port depending on `proto_pass`
4. **const char** \*_parse_hostname(const char \*data)\
Removes hostname from `data` and returns.\
If hostname is not present, returns `data` as it is.

## Acknowledgement
I'm grateful to my mentors Tim RÃ¼hsen and Darshit Shah for their guidance. Their sound knowledge has been a constant source of motivation for me. I'd also like to thank Christian Grothoff (libmicrohttpd), Evgeny Grin (libmicrohttpd), Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos (GnuTLS), Maru Berezin for her work libmicrohttpd-http2, and all of the GNU Community. Google Summer of Code has been a very insightful experience for me and I'm taking away much from it. I'm motivated to keep contributing to the project.
