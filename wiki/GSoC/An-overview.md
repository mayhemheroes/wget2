# GNU Wget2: Google Summer of Code

GNU Wget and Wget2 participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program under the GNU Project. Hence, you must apply to The GNU Project to participate with us.

In order to apply to GNU Wget, you must follow the guidelines as outlined [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/guidelines.html). The proposal **MUST** be submitted in the standard GNU format, else it will not be considered. Please take a look at the proposal format linked below.

Go through all the relevant pages linked here to understand the process of participating in GSoC with GNU Wget and to improve your chances of selection.

_students_ and _mentors_ if you think you can improve this page, please do so! It's a wiki.

**Students**: You should take a look at the GSoC Timeline to make sure that you finish all the required actions before their deadlines.
