Pros and Cons of **NOT** submitting Wget2 to GNU.

| Pros | Cons |
|:-----|:-----|
| No more ugly GNU style | |
| | GNU is famous and respected. Good SEO for gnu.org. Wget itself is well-known and widely deployed. Wget2 is not. |
| | We may not be able to use the Wget2 name and will have to probably find a new one, since Wget is owned by GNU (FSF). |
| | Probably no GSoC in the short term. [1] |
| No need to engage in lawyerly issues. Or at least not those from GNU. This makes the project more friendly to newcomers and thus more likely to attract developers. | |
| | Need to handle copyright issues ourselves. What happens when you want to re-license for some reason? Getting signatures from *all* contributors is painful. |
| We can choose our platforms and tools at will (e.g. GitHub) | |

[1]: While I think it is too early to look for GSoC students in 2016. We can definitely get some for 2017 without GNU. Also, in case we do progress enough to have a codebase for students to work on (includes having a public release and documentation), we can definitely try for 2016 too. - @darnir
